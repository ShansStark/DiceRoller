# Dice Roller Application with Flutter

## Overview
This is a simple Flutter application that simulates rolling a dice. It's a basic static quiz application created as part of my Flutter course, inspired by the course content.

## Dice Roller Model Layout
- A simple button to roll the dice.
- Dice images displaying all six possible outcomes.
- A single screen user interface.

## Tools and Data Types Used
- Implemented a basic Scaffold widget for the app's structure.
- Utilized Box decoration with properties like gradient and color to style the interface.
- Created a stateful widget to change the dice image when the button is clicked.
- Imported dice images in the `pubspec.yaml` file and aligned them properly.
- Styled text with font color and bold formatting.
- Passed a function to the button to execute the roll action.
- Utilized the math package to generate random numbers for randomizing the dice images.
